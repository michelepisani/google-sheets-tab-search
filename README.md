Do you often work with complex Google Sheets containing dozens of tabs?



Navigating through many tabs can be frustrating. The native "All sheets" menu (the burger menu icon at the bottom left) only displays a long list that is hard to scroll through.



Quick Tab Search solves this problem by instantly adding a search bar to the top of that menu.



🚀 HOW IT WORKS:



Click the "All sheets" icon (burger menu) at the bottom left of your spreadsheet.



Immediately start typing the name of the sheet you are looking for.



Press ENTER to jump to the first result or click on the desired sheet.



✨ FEATURES:



Real-time search: the list filters as you type.



Auto-focus: no need to click on the search bar, just start typing.



Keyboard navigation: use arrows or press Enter to confirm.



Zero configuration: install it and it works immediately on all your sheets.



🔒 PRIVACY: This extension operates 100% locally on your browser. It does not collect, save, or send any data to external servers. Your sheet names remain private.
